# HostMatch

`hostmatch` is a tool to easily generate reader-friendly hostnames for fast
local development. For example, instead of typing

`localhost:3000`

every time you need to view the page of a local webserver, hostmatch allows you
to do something like this:

`projectname.dev`

Hostmatch provides a lot more functionality but this is the intended use-case
and the one all other functionalities revolve around.
